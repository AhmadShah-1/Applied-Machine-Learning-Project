Each feature (e.g., C3_Wavelet_F1) represents a scalar summary statistic extracted from a time window of EEG signal, such as:

Mean wavelet power in a specific frequency band
Energy or variance in that frequency band
Coefficient value from the wavelet transform

EEG data are originally time-series signals, but they are compressed into feature vectors to make them suitable for machine learning models (like LDA, SVM, CNN, etc.).
That’s why each column is a single scalar per trial instead of a range or array of values.
