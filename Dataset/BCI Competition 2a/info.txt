AOxT are used for training 
AOxE are used for validation by judges 


The location for the lablel data is in the gdf header, so those with the label data are stored in "Trials"

all CSVs of both E and T are stored in "CSV" but nethier contain the label data, just there for now until needed

User Trials for training and validation

There are 4 states (Event Codes: [769, 770, 7712, 772]) these mean respectively [Left-hand cue, Right-hand cue, feet cue, tongue cue]
which i remapped to be class labels [1, 2, 3, 4]

Attached is also the detailed description of the project, from my understanding they aren't asked to move their body parts, but rather
to visualize moving it in their heads. (MOTOR IMAGERY) this is for the system to recognize thought, and not motion, to avoid muscle artifacts

The file contains EEG and 3 EOG channels (left, central, right) 

Avoid using EOG channels, they are being used to detect eye movements, and because of the high electrical potential it theoretically will always
be the root to all trees (if using random forest), and as different individuals may look right or left unconciously, it will skew 
uncertainity into the dataset, paired with the high electrical potential, it would be best to ignore these 3 channels.
